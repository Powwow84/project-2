## Concept

The idea of Finda is a social media app targeted at people who like to fish. Users can:

* Look for examples of fish species
* Search for different types of fish

* And see what other fish people have caught


## API's to be used

MVP

* Create and populate a screen that displays other users catches
* Create and display a screen that displays catches by fish id/name
* Add to a fishing bucket list
* Remove from a fishing bucket list
 

## Super Stretch Goals
* Add catch locations using google api

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Potential roadblocks

* Uploading images into the cloud using cloudinary api
* Learning how to implement the google maps api to add catch location

### Roadblocks actually hit

* Ran into an roodblock when trying to send information from multiple tables in one action. I could not figure out why I wasn't getting the primary key of the user_fish table. 
    - The solution came after talking to Instructor weston who pointed me the table relations. From there I went back to the docs then set the relationary data correctly which then gave me the data I needed. This one piece was reusable across multiple pages as I use the same data in multiple places

* Ran into another roadblock when trying to set my project up to use import instead of require because I did not see that the uploadcare documentation had a require option . That set me back 2 hours.
    - I decided to step back and do more digging into the docs I just decided to try using the require method with the information from their import example and it workedü§∑

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Post project reflection

* I think I should have taken more time to understand my data tables and how they would relate to each other first before starting the project. the place where I spent the most time was trying to figure out how to get relational data from the tables.
* Also I would not do my own custom css as that burned more time where I could have spent on functionality.
    - with that said though I think that taking a break from functionality to look work on style gave me a reset and helped me with my functionality when I got back to it

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Future functionality
* Add to bucketlist
* Add catch from bucketlist
* Comment on a post
* Like a post
